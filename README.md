## Welcome to ReDU-MS2 :)
ReDU-MS2 is a web-based user interface that can be used to easily Analyze Your Data or Analyze Public Data mass spectrometry data, specifically MS2 (aka tandem mass spectrometry, MS2, MS/MS) data. The user interface allows one to select public mass spectrometry files in MassIVE, a public mass spectrometry data repository, based on a curated set of sample information and launch reanalyses in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking GNPS platform.

MS2 data, specifically product ion scans, are obtained from user-submitted open-source data files (.mzXML) and analyzed de novo using molecular networking and chemical annotations within GNPS. This is a community effort and everyone is encourage to participate by submitting their own data and sample information.


## Metadata format
This is a tsv file that requires a column for the dataset accession with header MassiveID. Then attributes that will be included as metadata categories.


## Data Availability 
All sample information can be downloaded from the ReDU-MS2 homepage by clicking "Download Database". Anyone who creates a custom code is encouraged to share it with the rest of ReDU-MS2 users.


## Analyze Your Data
You can compare your data to public data by projecting it on to a pre-calculated PCA plot of the public data. Additonally, you can coanalyze your data with the public data through GNPS by launching Molecular Networking, Library Search, Chemical Enrichment Analysis. 


## Analyze the Public Data
All public data can be explored through a PCA interface. Chemical enrichment analysis and file association information is also viewable, and data can be filtered based on the provided sample information table. Furthermore, files can selected using this same sample information table for re-analysis in GNPS. Molecular Networking, Library Search, and Chemical Enrichment Analysis can all be run through GNPS
