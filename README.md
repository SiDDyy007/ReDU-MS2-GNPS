## Welcome to ReDU-MS2 :)
ReDU-MS2 is a web-based user interface that can be used to easily Analyze Your Data or Analyze Public Data mass spectrometry data, specifically MS2 (aka tandem mass spectrometry, MS2, MS/MS) data. The user interface allows one to select public mass spectrometry files in MassIVE, a public mass spectrometry data repository, based on a curated set of sample information and launch reanalyses in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking GNPS platform.

MS2 data, specifically product ion scans, are obtained from user-submitted open-source data files (.mzXML) and analyzed de novo using molecular networking and chemical annotations within GNPS. This is a community effort and everyone is encourage to participate by submitting their own data and sample information.


## Metadata format
This is a tsv file that requires a column for the dataset accession with header MassiveID. Then attributes that will be included as metadata categories.


## Data Availability 
All sample information can be downloaded from the ReDU-MS2 homepage by clicking "Download Database". Anyone who creates a custom code is encouraged to share it with the rest of ReDU-MS2 users.
